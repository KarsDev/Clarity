# Example code
```
class Person {
    var name
    var age

    constructor(name, age) {
        local.name = name
        local.age = age
    }

    fn greet() {
        native.println("My name is" + local.name + " and i'm " + local.age + " years old)
    }
}

fn factorial(n) {
    // You can also do
    // if n == 0 || n == 1 return 1
    
    if n == 0 || n == 1 {
        return 1
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
}

fn main() {

    var number = 5

    var fact = factorial(5)
    
    native.println("Factorial of " + number + " equals to " + fact)
}

# Easter egg (You'll like it trust)
Very easy to use simple and abstract main method.

  1. call method from the native library named "println" with this method you must supply the arguments of "Hello World" once done complete the execution and continue onto 
  the next and run the rest of this lovely file.
  
  2. After doing so use the included basic return library to return a simple value of a brand new generated new instance of a Void (included from the clarity void language package with version pro)

  3. Finish the execution - Thank you for your time!
